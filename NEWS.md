# TreatmentPatterns 2.6.1
---------
* Bumped R version to 4.2.1
* Added additional unit-tests for `createSunburstPlot2()` and `createSankeyDiagram2()`
* Updated to use DATEDIFF to compute difference between dates when fetching data from the database.
* Added functionality to choose how groups below the minimum cell count are censored.
* Made some parameters ambiguous for `createSankeyDiagram2` and `createSunburstPlot2()` for more control over the figures.
* Removed `addNoPath` parameter.
